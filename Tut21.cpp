/*
    An Object is an instance of a Class. When a class is defined, no memory is allocated but when it is instantiated (i.e. an object is created) memory is allocated.

    There are three access modifiers : public, private and protected.

    âœ¨ Note 1 :-  
        Any data memeber or function which is declared without without any access modifier is by default always private.

    âœ¨ Note 2 :-
        When static member is created, there is only a single copy of the data member which is SHARED b/w all the objects of the Class.

        The data members are Not Static
        i,e. Every objects created has an individual copy of the data member and it is Not Shared.

    âœ¨ Note 3 :-
        When a static method is created, they become independent of any object and class. Static methods can only access static data members and static methods. Static methods can only be accessed using the scope resolution operator.

    There are 2 ways to define a member function:
    1.    Inside class definition
    2.    Outside class definition

            To define a member function outside the class definition we have to use the scope resolution :: operator along with class name and function name.
